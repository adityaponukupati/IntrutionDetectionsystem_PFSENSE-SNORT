# IntrutionDetectionsystem_PFSENSE-SNORT

# Project Overview
This project is demonstration and implementation of intrusion detection system using pfsense and snort using a virtual machine network environment and the goal of this project is to protect a virtual Windows machine from various kinds of threats by monitoring network traffic and identifying attacks.

# Tools Used
GNS3.
PFsense.
Snort.
Virtual Windows Machine. 

# Configuration for GNS3 & PFSENSE
Create a virtual network using GNS3 which includes Routers and switches to simulate network. 
A pfsense firewall to act as a security gateway. 
Configure a virtual Windows machine as the target system. 
Assign static IP address to all devices within the network.
Configure PFsense as firewall
Create firewall rules to control inbound and outbound traffic. 
Implement port forwarding and NAT rules as needed. 
Install and configure snort. 
Customize Snort rules to detect relevant threats. 
Set up alert mechanisms for detecting intrusions. 
Create and customize Snort rules to detect a wide range of attacks, including Port scans DoS attacks, Web application attacks, Malware infections Evasion techniques Testing & Evaluation.

# Simulate Attacks

Use tools like Scapy, hping3, or Metasploit to simulate various attacks against the virtual Windows machine. 
Monitor Snort Alerts
Analyze PFsense Logs
Fine-Tune Rules

# Security Best Practices

comply with security best practices such as stronger password policies and user awareness training. 
Stay updated on the latest threats to effectively configure Snort rules. 
create an incident response plan to handle security events effectively. 

# Integration with SIEM
Integrate Snort and pfsense logs with a Security Information and Event Management solution for centralized monitoring and analysis. 
Apply machine learning techniques to improve threat detection and reduce false positives. 
Conduct regular red teaming and penetration testing exercises to identify vulnerabilities.
